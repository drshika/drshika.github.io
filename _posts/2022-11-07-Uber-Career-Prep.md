This past year, I participated in the Uber Career Prep Fellowship, a seven-month program with five virtual workshops ranging in content from technical interview prep to learning about different careers in computing. In addition, the program has mock interviews and homework assignments to help expand your technical knowledge. I was also paired 1x1 with an Uber Engineer who guided me throughout the program. <!--more--> You'll also have ample opportunities to meet with members of Uber's employee resource groups, who will also be a considerable part of your Success in this one-of-a-kind experience!

All Uber Career Prep Fellows were allowed to interview for a paid summer 2023 internship position assuming all program requirements were met.

## Disclaimer

I'm not an Uber Recruiter, I can't get you hired or selected for the program, and none of this advice is official (unless otherwise stated). These are reflections based on the personal experience of past participants and me. 

## Ideal Candidates

CS/Computing adjacent students who have at least two interning summers left before they graduate. (for this year's program, you are graduating in 2025 or 2026)

## Comments on Diversity
Another fellow, Elias mentioned that he was the "the only Mexican in the 2022 cohort, with only 2 Latins total" (see his full article [here](https://medium.com/@EliasMaderaDeRegil/ucp-program-2022-how-uber-offers-a-one-of-a-kind-opportunity-for-cs-students-to-kick-start-their-dbb672a306ae)). 

I think Uber has a two pronged goal for this program; (1) Increase access to quality CS education and (2) Increase diversity in the recruiting pipeline. I feel like these goals are a little conflicting since recruiting priorities are to get the brightest minds from the top schools. Reaching genuinely marginalized people means reaching out to non-target schools and to folks in schools outside the US. The people who would genuinely benefit the most from the program are not overcommitted top students at Stanford, UIUC, Berkeley, Georgia Tech, Duke, Princeton and Columbia but actually folks in community college or no-name universities outside US who are still very smart but don't get opportunities.

## Homeworks
I cannot actually share the homework or the questions but make sure you can implement the following in your language of choice and use them to solve LC problems. 
1. Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues, and Recursion
2. Graphs and Trees
3. Sorting and Searching
4. Recursion and Dynamic Programming

## Mentorship
I got paired with a mentor at Uber, and we mostly spent sessions talking about homework assignments and mock interview feedback, and he connected me to a PM who works in accessibility since that's something I am interested in. 

## Conversion Interview
Two 1 hr interviews:
- 5 min introduction 
- 5 min behavioral 
- 45 min coding 
    - The actual coding aspect of the technical interview will occur in a shared editor or on the whiteboard (discretion of the interviewer).
    - All the questions should be short enough to explain in a few minutes and solvable in the time given.
    - Interviewers are looking for coding skills, problem-solving, and communication skills.
    General Algorithmic/Coding Questions
    - Data structures: Trees, Heaps, LinkedList, HashMaps
    - Concepts: Big-O notation, Recursion, Sorting algos etc
    Architecture Questions
    - How would you build a URL shortener service?
    - Design Facebook Newsfeed
    - Need to think about trade-offs, APIs, scalability
    Behavioral Question
    - "Tell me about a time you had to work closely with someone whose personality was diﬀerent  from your own..."
    - GOAL: get to the optimal solution
- 5 min Q+A 
    - In the remaining time, you'll have an opportunity to ask any questions related to Uber, speciﬁcally engineering, internships, or general career advice that you have.

My first interview was on Jul 25, and my second was on Jul 27. From what I heard, some fellows didn't get second rounds. The decisions were sent to us around Aug 18.
