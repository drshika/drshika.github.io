So, people have been asking me to write this because I have an entire workflow system that I can't live without. My setup isn't necessarily complicated or advanced, but I will attempt to keep this updated. So here you go Harsh ðŸ˜Š<!--more-->

## Laptop:
Operating System: MacOS Sonoma on a M3 Pro.

### Apps

- ðŸ’°[Alfred:](https://www.alfredapp.com/) I have paid for a license for this because I cannot live without the workflows they have. If you want a free alternative, try ðŸ†“ [https://www.raycast.com/](https://www.raycast.com/). I just like Alfred's UX better and have been using it forever.

  - [Download Media](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/download-media-workflow/)
  - [Homebrew](https://chris-grieser.de/)
- ðŸ’°[BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) I use this for trackpad, mouse gestures, and window management. I paid for this, and it replaces many free/paid apps for me. 
  - Apps Replaced:
    - ðŸ†“ [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) or ðŸ’°[Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/index.html) are ones I have used, and I think they are basically identical window managers. BTT has most of this, and I'd recommend Rectangle for folks who want window management. [Comparison Sheet of Window Management Tools](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqyglRJXzxaj8OcQw9jHabxFUdsv9iWJXMPXcL7On0M/edit?gid=456166567#gid=456166567)
- ðŸ’° [SideNotes](https://www.apptorium.com/sidenotes) is a nice replacement for Apple Notes that supports markdown and syncs with iCloud. Also conveniently accessible to the side of your workspace, I love that you can create different folders for different projects. 
- ðŸ†“ [OnlySwitch](https://github.com/jacklandrin/OnlySwitch) is a nice bunch of quick settings to have at your fingertips.
- ðŸ†“ [Hyperduck](https://sindresorhus.com/hyperduck) send links offline to your mac
- ðŸ†“ [Ice](https://icemenubar.app/) is a free alternative to ðŸ’°[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) and hides all the annoying stuff like creative cloud and JetBrains while still keeping it accessible. Also supports a second menu bar
- ðŸ†“ [Dropshelf](https://pilotmoon.com/dropshelf/) free alternative to ðŸ’°[Dropover](https://dropoverapp.com/). 
- ðŸ†“ [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats) free alternative to ðŸ’°[iStatMenus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)
- ðŸ†“ [PearCleaner](https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner) is a huge improvement over AppCleaner, which I have used and love. 
  Note: I used to use the Setapp iCleanMyMac thing but didn't feel like the subscription was worth it, considering AppCleaner worked better. I know a lot of people rave about SetApp, but honestly, I'm not a superpower user, and most apps I like I get for free. The few ones I like paying for are one-time lifetime access types. 
- ðŸ†“ [Via](https://www.caniusevia.com/) A nice keyboard remapping GUI for your VIA-compatible keyboards. Super nice for configuring my split keyboard.
- ðŸ’° [Cork](https://corkmac.app/) I've been trialing this app and really liked the UX. I'm unsure if I'll keep it since I frequently start from scratch with my laptop. 
- ðŸ’° [BusyCal](https://www.busymac.com/busycal/) or ðŸ†“ [ItsyCal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/), ðŸ’° [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical). I'm currently an ItsyCal stan, given it's free. BusyCal doesn't integrate with my work calendar; otherwise, I'd pay for it (still trialing). Fantastic used to be my daily driver, but I'm not a huge fan of the subscription model. I love Fantastical and BusyCal for the Natural Language event creation, but I am still searching for my holy grail. 
- Mail: I just used the built-in Apple Mail app since my work account is fine. 
- Spotify â†’ ðŸ†“ [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli)
    - I use Spotify to customize my Spotify installation. I'm currently running Catppuccin theme and Anonymized Radios, CatJam Synced, Immersive View, Remove Unplayable songs, Shuffle+, Sleep Timer, Toggle DJ, Dynamic Left Sidebar, Hide Made for You, Nyan Cat Progress Bar (Installed from the Store extension)
- Text Editors: Vim, ðŸ†“[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
    - My Vim config is pretty default because I mostly use it for short one-off things
    - I use my ðŸ’° anthropic API key with Claude 3.5 to help me with work. Otherwise, I have JSON linters, Live Preview, Live Share, Color Highlights, Spell Check, and [pyenv manager](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python-environment-manager) for working with conda. The theme is still quite light. The rest of the extensions are mostly whatever I need to develop.
- Terminal: ðŸ†“ [iterm 2](https://iterm2.com/), 
    - Themes: [OhMyZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [Starship](https://starship.rs)
        - I use [these](https://gist.github.com/n1snt/454b879b8f0b7995740ae04c5fb5b7df) OhMyZSH plugins as of now since I recently switched over from fish shell. 
        - Cappuccino Latte Everything! Except for my slightly customized powershell prompt, which I will share in my complete dotfiles soon!

## Browser
I love treestyle tabs and firefox. And Zen browser is the perfect marriage of that. Arc is the closest chromium browser with that UX and I really just keep around all the browsers for my full stack work.
- [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/): I love compact mode, split screen and that I can use my favorite chrome extensions with this. This is my personal laptop daily driver. 
- [Arc Browser - Referral Link](https://arc.net/gift/13c590ff): has some nice features like PiP, freestyle** (not precisely the same but vertical layout with tab groups) tabs, tab groups, split screen, users, and more inbuilt. This is my work laptop daily driver. 

### Browser Extensions
- [Ublock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) If Chrome stops supporting this, I'm throwing hands. Best AdBlocker period.
- [Hide Google AI Overviews](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hide-google-ai-overviews/neibhohkbmfjninidnaoacabkjonbahn) Self explanatory, they usually suck. 
- [SponsorBlock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone) also self explanatory. 
- [Bitwarden](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bitwarden-password-manage/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb) my preferred password manager since high school.

## Old Stuff

- [Anytype:](https://anytype.io/) Selfhosted Notion. I've been alpha-testing Anytype for a little bit, and I've been enjoying it. I'll stick with the notion since the cloud is much more convenient than manually backing up local stuff.
â€”[Typora:] (https://typora.io/) is my holy grail markdown editor. It has nice LaTeX support. I use the default theme with Github syntax highlighting and Dracula in the dark mode.
