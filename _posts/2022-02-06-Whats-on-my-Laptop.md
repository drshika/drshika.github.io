So people have been asking me to write this because I have an entire workflow system thing set up that I can‚Äôt really live without. My setup isn‚Äôt necessarily complicated or advanced but I will attempt to keep this updated. So here you go Harsh üòä

### Laptop: Macbook Pro 16‚Äù 2021 (M1)

- Apps
    - [Magnet:](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) super nice for window management! Once you can memorize the keyboard shortcuts, window management is arguably better than windows. I‚Äôve left the settings at default.
    - [Alfred:](https://www.alfredapp.com/) App Launcher, Password tracker, Calculator, Clipboard, Music Player, File Searcher. I swear this is something I cannot live without. Here are the workflows I like to use:
        - [Timer by Daniel Bader](https://github.com/dbader/alfred-countdown-timer)
        - [Search Notes by Sean Ballinger](https://github.com/sballin)
        - [Kill Proccess by Nathan Greenstein](https://github.com/ngreenstein/alfred-process-killer)
        - [clc by Avi Aryan](https://github.com/aviaryan/alfred-clc)
        - [Caffeinate Control by Shawn Patric Rice](https://www.packal.org/workflow/caffeinate-control)
        - [Downer Media by Vitor Galvao](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/DownMedia): this person has a really nice master list of workflows here: [https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows)
    - Markdown Editors
        - [Anytype:](https://anytype.io/) Selfhosted Notion. I‚Äôve been alpha testing Anytype for a little bit and I‚Äôve been enjoying it. I think I‚Äôll probably stick with notion though since cloud is soo much more convenient than having to manually back up local stuff.
        - [Typora:](https://typora.io/) My holy grail markdown editor. Has nice LaTeX support. I use the default theme with Github syntax highlighting and Dracula for the dark mode.
    - Spotify ‚Üí [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli)
        - I use Spicetify to customize my Spotify installation. I‚Äôm currently running DribblishDynamic and FullAppDisplay, shuffle+ and the reddit custom app.
    - Texteditors: Vim, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
        - My Vim config is pretty default because I mostly use it for short one off things
        - VSCode: The only extension I have that‚Äôs not a language support one is bracket pair colorizer. I highly reccomend it. I‚Äôm currently running quiet light but I think I want to switch around and come back to what themes/fonts/color schemes I like. I do like using light mode at night so maybe take my opinion with a grain of salt.
    - Terminal: [iterm 2](https://iterm2.com/), solarized light theme
        
        I alternate between Fish and Zsh. 
        
        - [Fish:](https://fishshell.com/) I use the ‚Äòsnow day‚Äô colors from the default options available in config
        - ZSH: [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is the only plugin I use

Browser: Firefox

- [MaterialFox](https://github.com/muckSponge/MaterialFox), using this for my usercss because I‚Äôm a normie and I‚Äôm too lazy to port my chrome workflow to Firefox
- Extensions:
    - [CheckerPlus 4 Gmail](https://jasonsavard.com/?ref=homepage_url&ext=gmail): Super useful for when you‚Äôre sending email confirmations to your personal account and also waiting on mails from your work account. Do I recommend for people who are busy and actually have a life? NO. Usually this thing is just muted lmao
    - [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/): Because I can‚Äôt be bothered to remember 133 passwords on different sites with different requirements *sigh*
    - [Disabled] [Sideberry](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery): Great Tree-Style-Tab extension for firefox but I‚Äôve yet to get used to that so I just don‚Äôt use it.
    - [TabStash:](https://josh-berry.github.io/tab-stash/) I use it to tuck away some tabs when I want to switch tasks, which is very often, and then revisit those tabs later. Super convenient for setting up class-based workspaces for school that I can pop in and out of without having to remember what tabs I need open for certain assignments.
    - [UBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin): I use this to block trackers and make my browser run faster :)
    - [Save to Notion:](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper) I use this to keep track of cool articles and job postings I apply to. I have a template linked somewhere on this website for the database that I store my job apps in.
    - [Reading List:](https://github.com/alexpdraper/reading-list/) This is basically a replacement for chrome‚Äôs reading list but honestly I could just make a bookmark folder for this and delete the extension. The only thing that‚Äôs nice is that it keeps track of what you‚Äôve read and what you have not albeit buggily.
    - [LeechBlock](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/): I use to block sites when I need to focus in. You could honestly use it to block anything for any reason gg
    - [NuTab](https://nutab.co/): This is what I use to mock me when i‚Äôm not at peak 100% chad productivity. I make a giant todo list and every time I open a tab, my list stares back at me,,, mocking me for not completing tasks. But yet I still procrastinate *sigh*
    - [Octotree](https://www.octotree.io/): nice little tool for navigating big github repos. You can basically see the file structure of any public non org repo in a side pane. You can navigate all the folders without leaving the page that you‚Äôre on so this is perfect for devs.
    - [Newsfeed Eradicator:](https://west.io/news-feed-eradicator/) Gets rid of the most addictive part of social media for me. It basically prevents me from using Leechblock unless it‚Äôs a truly desperate situation.
