# Microsoft Research Internships

This is **unofficial**, largely anecdote-based advice on getting hired for the Microsoft Undergraduate Research Internship at Microsoft. This doc covers who the program is looking for, what the application requires, prompts, interview process, decision process, offers and what happens next. I decided to create this since there isn’t much information available online about this program. 
<!--more-->
source: I was offered a position for this program in 2022.

## Disclaimer

Again: I'm not a Microsoft recruiter, I can't get you hired here, and none of this advice is official (unless otherwise stated). These are reflections based on personal experience of past interns and me. I'm putting this right at the top and reiterating it so I don't have to say "my personal opinion is..." in every sentence.

## Ideal Candidates

From program coordinators: juniors/seniors who have some interest in research and are **committed to diversity and inclusion**

## Application

- CV or Resume
    - I submitted a CV to make space for publications, volunteering/clubs. See this site for how to craft your CV: [https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/quick-tips/CV.pdf](https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/quick-tips/CV.pdf)
- 2 or 3 Reference Letters
    - I submitted one from my PI and one from the coordinator of a research d&i program I was part of. The coordinator of this program happened to be the head of the CS department at my university.
    - Tip: reach out to your recommenders 3-4 weeks in advance (or whenever the program opens) so that you can get the best possible letter.
    - If you have never asked for a LOR before here’s how it works. Ask your recommender in person, follow up with asking via email and then send them to invitation on the portal.
        
        > Hello Professor xyz, 
        
        Hope you are doing well. My name is <name> and I am/was in your <lab> as <role> <research intern>. I am interested in applying for the Microsoft Undergraduate Research Internship <link here> and I was wondering if you would be able to write me a recommendation letter. The application is due *Nov 19th, 2021*. 
        
        I feel like you would be an excellent person to speak to my contributions with <xyz>. If this is something you would have the capacity to do, please let me know what information you need for me (or if you would like to set up a quick meeting to gather the information you need) and I can provide that to you.
        
        Best,
        > 
    - Be prepared to provide your recommender with a list of your accomplishments so that they can write you the strongest letter possible.
- Two Essays
    1. Essay 1: Research interest statement (500 words or fewer)
        1. Select up to three desired research areas. (See section “MSR Research Areas” below).
        2. Answer the prompt: *What **draws** you to the desired research area(s) you selected and what **impact** would you like to have in that space?*
        3. Be sure to also describe:
            1. any relevant experience in this/these research area(s) and
            2. how you expect to personally benefit from participating in this internship.
        4. Tips: make sure you answer each part of the questions, cite any publications properly and what conferences they were submitted/accepted to or were a student reviewer for. Relate your research experiences to the research areas at Microsoft Research. If you have a very personal reason for getting into research (other than it’s cool) this is a good place to mention it. 
    2. Essay 2: Leadership in Diversity statement (250 words or fewer)
        1. Please describe ways you have **contributed to increasing
        diversity** and inclusion in your field and/or any unique challenges you
        may have faced and how you navigated those obstacles
        2. Tips: this is a weed out questions for interviews so make sure you write a serious answer for this! I just talked about all the advocacy work that I have done in the past and what efforts I remain involved with at the moment. 
- MY ESSAYS
    
    *Answer the prompt: What draws you to the desired research area(s) you selected and what **impact would you like to have in that space**?*
    
    Research Areas chosen: Human-Computer interaction, Social Sciences, Human Language Technologies.
    
    When I was younger, It was common to interact with strangers on the internet with little to no moderation in place. Once, in middle school, I was harassed on an online site by a stranger, which scared me to interact freely with others online. Years later, as a freshman in college, I began working in UIUC's Social Computing Laboratory (SCUBA) and was introduced to the extensive breadth of research done in online moderation. Through my work with the SCUBA lab, I have become incredibly passionate about examining the factors that promote antisocial behavior on social networking sites and what we can do to reduce that kind of behavior.
    
    I began working with SCUBA through UIUC's Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. I worked closely with a graduate student in the lab on moderation on audio-based social platforms (ABSPs) such as Clubhouse, Discord, and Twitter Spaces. I scraped Twitter for tweets about moderation and user perspectives which helped my graduate mentor develop a novel analytical framework called MIC to understand voice-based social apps' affordances. This work eventually culminated into the paper [1], which is currently in a revision cycle with ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW), a top-tier Human-Computer Interaction Conference.
    
    In addition to contributing to the MIC project, I investigated other apps like Clubhouse, such as Twitter Spaces, Discord Stages, and Spotify Greenroom. I learned an NLP technique called Topic Modeling to analyze the different kinds of conversations surrounding these apps on Twitter to analyze these tweets. The two types of models I used were Sparse Additive Generative Models (SAGE) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
    
    Currently, I'm working with another graduate student in SCUBA on community resiliency and what factors promote disruptive behavior in college subreddits. In addition, I'm working on an online dashboard to visualize removed comments and identify trends in commenting behavior.
    
    As a result of my experiences, I'm interested in studying what creates safer, inclusive online spaces and building computational tools to measure and build this. To do so, I wish to focus my research on Human-Computer Interaction, Social Sciences, and Human Language technologies. I'd also like to learn more about improving accessibility or examining the impacts of technology on disabled individuals as a part of building inclusive online spaces.
    
    While moderation research genuinely excites me, I am open to working in other areas to build my skill set. The Microsoft Undergraduate Research Program can empower me to continue learning more about HCI through exposure to Microsoft researchers, visiting faculty, data and applied scientists, engineers, designers, and doctoral students. Industry research is probably very different from how it is structured in academia, and I would love to learn how the research mentorship process works at Microsoft.

    When I was first exposed to computer science, it was in a classroom full of loud and confident male students who raced far ahead of the lectures to do fun side projects while I silently struggled with getting my command prompt to print "Hello World." Since then, I have worked hard to develop my skills and confidence in computer science and helped my female and URM peers. During my high school years, I was the president of our school's computer science club and organized many workshops and an event called "Girls Night of Code" during my sophomore-senior year to encourage middle school girls to pursue computer science.
    
    In college, I continue my commitment towards bridging the gender gap in computing by working closely with CS RSOs like Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and WCS (Women in Computer Science). In addition, I'm actively involved with mentorship through the ACM Mentorship program and other national organizations like NCWIT (National Center for Women in Technology) and RTC (Rewriting the Code).
    
    This semester, the department recognized my research and outreach efforts, and I was selected to be a CS STARS ambassador. I'm fully funded to research with the SCUBA Lab. This program helps us build research skills while also interfacing with faculty and administration on increasing the number of women and URMs in research. We also organized events like Trick-Or-Research, to connect faculty and research opportunities to undergraduates looking to learn more about research.
    

## Interview Process/Timeline

Here was my timeline with the program:

October 4th-November 19th, 2021 - Applications portal is open

December 16, 2021 - Got an email from program coordinator about interview scheduling:

> Dear Drshika,

Congratulations! We are impressed by your application and are pleased to share that we would like to move forward and schedule an interview. The interview will consist of a few people from Microsoft Research, and you can expect it to last 40-45 minutes. I’m emailing you today to let you know that someone from MSR will be reaching out, however, they may also have taken off for vacation! So, if you do not hear from us in the next few days, you certainly should before January 7th.

If you have any questions or any deadlines we should know of, please let us know.
> 

December 27, 2021 - Got an email from my interviewers

> Hi Drshika,

Congratulations! We have reviewed your submission to the Microsoft Research (MSR) Undergraduate Research Internship and would like to schedule you for an interview.

I'm <interviewer name>, and I will be conducting the interview. I’m Sr. Principal Researcher in the Productivity and Intelligence group in MSR. My research is on improving productivity of software engineers and data science using AI-based software systems. We will also be joined by at least one more researcher and I will let you know their names closer to the interview.

We hold the interviews online via Teams, and you can expect the interview to last 40-45 minutes. To help me schedule the interview, please let me know your availability on January 5-7.

All internships will be virtual this summer, you must be physically present in the United States or Canada during the internship.

Thanks, and I look forward to meeting you soon!
> 

January 17, 2022 - Got an email from another program coordinator for a quick followup (this doesn’t happen for all candidates but for the sake of transparency):

> Hi Drshika,

My name is <researcher two> and I am one of the organizers of the Microsoft Research Internship program.  I was wondering if you had time this week for a quick meeting?  Some of the work you are interested in pursuing overlaps with my current research efforts. I would love to meet you and hear more about your work and interests.
> 

January 19, 2022- Got another email from a researcher for a quick follow up chat:

> Hi Drshika,

I am part of the undergrad intern program and I was wondering if you would have some free time to chat today or tomorrow?

pre-qualification questions – including that we have asked you to apply. You don’t need to resubmit your essays. If it is more complicated than that please let me know.) **Please let me know when you’ve completed this step**.

2. **Please let me know your preferred start date** (any Monday in May or June 2022 but the earlier the better for your project). It can be adjusted before you start.
> 

## Decision Process

Here are the numbers (from the program coordinators):

There are about ~400 applications each year. 

1st round: ~50 people get interviewed. 

The committee judges applicants solely on the written materials. You typically interview with 1-3 people who ask you about your essays and work. Your interview has a domain expert and 0-2 other people there to be unbiased judges. Try to read up about your interviewers ahead of time so that you have some questions to ask them about their work. Or you can relate your work to theirs. The domain expert most likely takes you on as an intern if you get accepted (and they have the capacity for interns) or helps find someone else in one of your top three choices to be your mentor. 

The program is not rolling, therefore everyone who is selected after this round will be matched to mentors afterwards, not based on a rolling thing of mentors choose people as you interview. Therefore, there is no benefit of interviewing earlier. 

Around the third week of Jan, interviews wrap up and people are assigned to mentors. In the case that you don’t have a mentor, the coordinators will help you select a mentor. In the case that there are two mentors fighting over you for a project, they will choose the mentor that best aligns with your goals from the program. 

Make sure you reach out to the program coordinators and/or your interviewers if you have any questions or **offers** from other companies so they can speed up the process.

## Interview Question Examples

Expect behavioral questions as well as questions about your research, methodology, what you liked/disliked/learned from your research and what you hope to gain from the internship. Based on what team you’re interviewing for, they may ask you a coding question (someone who was interviewing for Distributed Systems research said they had a coding section of their interview)

MSR is an opportunity to do research for people who like to be really hands on about researching. Since you’re an undergraduate, most of your work has probably been hands on, so take advantage of that and talk about your impact!

Make sure you can explain your research to non-technical people and do some mock interviews with other grad students or your PI.

**Questions about you and your research**

1. Tell us a little bit about yourself!
    1. Here’s what I said for mine. I like to write my elevator pitches out in bullet points so that it’s easier for me to memorize. 
    
    > computer science with a minor in statistics at UIUC
    research interests
    > 
    > - HCI
    > - Natural Language Processing
    > - Accessibility
    > 
    > Social CompUting laBorAtory
    > 
    > - Summer: Classifying Voice Social Platforms (ABSPs) (Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces)
    >     - Submitted to ACM CSCW (in review cycle)
    > - Fall: Project about community resiliency on Reddit.
2. What kind of projects have you worked on and what have your contributions been in them?
3. Could you explain x concept in further depth (explain the concept non-technically)?
4. Why did you make x choice with your research?
5. What were the hardest parts of the research process? What parts of the research process did  you dislike and why?
6. What are some conclusions you drew from this research?
7. What is the significance of your research?
8. Did you enjoy x part of the process?
9. What are some challenges you encountered?
10. What are some future routes you hope to take with this project?
11. What are some of your strengths and weaknesses?

**Questions about you and MSR**

1. What do you look for in a good mentor?
2. Did you enjoy working with x mentor? What about them did you like or dislike?
3. What would you consider a good outcome from the internship?
    1. examples are learning a method or technical skill, publishing, working on a certain type of project (kind of risky if that project is unavailable).
4. What kind of work would you like to do? What kind of contributions would you want to make to projects?
    1. methods, writing, technical skills, publishing etc.
    

**Questions about methods** 

They did not ask me much of these but they can ask these to anyone!

1. Explain how would you analyze data.
2. Explain x technical concept
3. Maybe a easy ish leetcode question to check that you know how to code

**Last part: ask the interviewer(s) questions**

Here are some example questions you can ask your interviewers:

1. What kind of projects have previous interns worked with?
2. I don’t have much access to what industrial research internships look like, so what would be the scope of my role and contributions be as an intern?

## Offers and Compensation

Thought I’d include this since I was unable to find any information on how much interns were compensated online.

**Monetary Compensation**

- $7500-8000/month salary (I’ve heard people getting in this range based on seniority and experience)
- $3500 housing stipend (this was during COVID-19 when the internship was virtual but afaik, it goes up to 7000$ for in-person internships)
- $450 credit for Microsoft software

**Other Details**

- You can choose your start and end date (they give you a table to help you decide)
- Health insurance is included for the time that you are an intern
- From past virtual years, it seems like they send you a computer (usually a thinkpad or surface), mouse, monitor, headphones or something along those lines. Also if there’s something specific your lab uses to do work, they will probably also send that to you. I’ll keep this updated on what happens with me since I’m in a VR Research Lab.
