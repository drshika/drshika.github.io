This guide is **unofficial**, largely anecdote-based advice on getting hired for the Microsoft Undergraduate Research Internship at Microsoft. This document covers who the program is looking for, what the application requires, prompts, the interview process, the decision process, offers, and what happens next. I decided to create this since there isn't much online information about this program.

source: I was an intern in this program in 2022.

## Disclaimer

Again, I'm not a Microsoft recruiter; I can't get you hired here, and none of this advice is official (unless otherwise stated). These are reflections based on the personal experiences of past interns and me. I'm putting this right at the top and reiterating it so I don't have to say, "My personal opinion is..." in every sentence.

## Ideal Candidates

Juniors/seniors who have some interest in research *(no prior research experience necessary)*

## Application

- CV or Resume
    - I submitted a CV to make space for publications, volunteering, and clubs. See this site for how to craft your CV: [https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/quick-tips/CV.pdf](https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/quick-tips/CV.pdf)
- 2 or 3 Reference Letters
    - I submitted one from my PI and one from the coordinator of a research D&I program I was part of. The coordinator of this program was the head of the CS department at my university.
    - Tip: reach out to your recommenders 3-4 weeks in advance (or whenever the program opens) so that you can get the best possible letter.
    - If you have never asked for a Letter of recommendation before, here's how it works. Ask your recommender in person, follow up with asking via email, and then send them an invitation on the portal.
        
        > Hello Professor XYZ, 
        > 
        > I hope you are doing well. My name is (name), and I am/was in your (lab) as (role) (research intern). I am interested in applying for the Microsoft Undergraduate Research Internship (link here) and would like to know if you can write me a recommendation letter. The application is due November 19, 2021. 
        >
        >I believe you would be an excellent person to discuss my contributions with (XYZ). If you can do this, please let me know what information you need from me (or if you would like to set up a quick meeting to gather the information you need), and I can provide that to you.
        >
        >Best,
    
    - Be prepared to provide your recommender with a list of accomplishments so they can write you the strongest letter possible.
- Two Essays
    1. Essay 1: Research interest statement (500 words or fewer)
        1. Select up to three desired research areas. (See section "MSR Research Areas" below).
        2. Answer the prompt: *What **draws** you to the desired research area(s) you selected and what **impact** would you like to have in that space?*
        3. Be sure also to describe:
            1. any relevant experience in this/these research area(s) and
            2. how do you expect to benefit from participating in this internship?
        4. Tips: Ensure you answer each part of the questions, cite any publications properly, and know the conferences for which they were submitted/accepted or were student reviewers. Relate your research experiences to the research areas at Microsoft Research. If you have a personal reason for getting into research (other than it's cool), this is a good place to mention it. 
    2. Essay 2: Leadership in Diversity statement (250 words or fewer)
        1. Please describe ways you have **contributed to increasing
 diversity** and inclusion in your field and/or any unique challenges you
 may have faced and how you navigated those obstacles
        2. Tips: quantify your accomplishments and provide key results/who impacted each.
    

## Interview Process/Timeline

Here is my timeline with the program:

October 4th-November 19th, 2021 - Applications portal is open

December 16, 2021 - I got an email from the program coordinator about interview scheduling:

> Dear Drshika,
>
>Congratulations! We are impressed by your application and are pleased to share that we would like to move forward and schedule an interview. The interview will consist of a few people from Microsoft Research, and you can expect it to last 40-45 minutes. I'm emailing you today to inform you that someone from MSR will be reaching out. However, they may also have taken off for vacation! So, if you do not hear from us in the next few days, you certainly should before January 7.
>
>If you have any questions or any deadlines we should know of, please let us know.
> 

December 27, 2021 - I got an email from my interviewer.

> Hi Drshika,
>
>Congratulations! We have reviewed your submission to the Microsoft Research (MSR) Undergraduate Research Internship and would like to schedule you for an interview.
>
> I'm (interviewer name) and will conduct the interview. I'm the senior principal Researcher in the (redacted) group in MSR. My research is on (redacted). At least one more Researcher will join us, and I will let you know their names closer to the interview.
>
>We hold the interviews online via Teams, and they will last 40-45 minutes. Please let me know your availability on January 5-7 to help me schedule the interview.
>
> Although all internships will be virtual this summer, you must be physically present in the United States or Canada during the internship.
>
>Thanks, and I look forward to meeting you soon!
> 

January 17, 2022 - I got an email from another program coordinator for a quick follow-up (this doesn't happen for all candidates, but for the sake of transparency):

> Hi Drshika,
>
>My name is (Researcher Two), and I am one of the Microsoft Research Internship program organizers.  Do you have time this week for a quick meeting—some of the work you want to pursue overlaps with my current research efforts. I would love to meet you and hear more about your work and interests.


January 19, 2022- I got another email from a researcher for a quick follow-up chat:

> Hi Drshika,
>
>I am part of the undergrad intern program. Do you have some free time to chat today or tomorrow?


January 28, 2022 - Some people I talked to got their offers!

January 31, 2022 - I got my offer! 

> Dear Drshika,
>
>Congratulations! We think you'd be a great addition to our program. We recommend you for one of the MSR Undergraduate Internship positions and are really excited to work with you this summer. You will be mentored by (mentor name) in the Microsoft Research at Redmond lab (virtually).
>
>For us to extend an official offer:
>
>1. We need you to first apply to the program via this website:
[redacted link] (You should only need to upload a resume or CV and answer the
pre-qualification questions, including those that we have asked you to apply for. You don't need to resubmit your essays. If it is more complicated than that, please let me know.) **Please let me know when you've completed this step**.
>
>2. **Please let me know your preferred start date** (any Monday in May or June 2022, but the earlier, the better for your project). You can adjust it before you start.
>

## Decision Process

Here are the numbers (from the program coordinators):

There are about ~400 applications each year. 

1st round: ~50 people get interviewed. 

The committee judges applicants solely on the written materials. You typically interview with 1-3 people who ask you about your essays and work. Your interview has a domain expert and 0-2 other people there to be unbiased judges. Try to read up about your interviewers beforehand so that you have some questions to ask them about their work. Or you can relate your work to theirs. The domain expert will take you on as an intern if you get accepted (and they have the capacity for interns) or help find someone else in one of your top three choices to be your mentor. 

The program is not rolling, so everyone selected after this round will be matched to mentors afterward. It is not based on a rolling thing where mentors choose people as you interview. Therefore, there is no benefit of interviewing earlier. 

Around the third week of January, interviews wrap up, and people are assigned mentors. If you don't have a mentor, the coordinators will help you select a mentor. If two mentors are fighting over you for a project, they will choose the mentor that best aligns with your goals from the program. 

Make sure you contact the program coordinators and/or your interviewers if you have any questions or offers from other companies so they can speed up the process.

## Interview Question Examples

Expect behavioral questions about your research and methodology, what you liked/disliked/learned from your research, and what you hope to gain from the internship. Based on what team you're interviewing for, they may ask you a coding question (someone who was interviewing for Distributed Systems research said they had a coding section of their interview)

MSR is an opportunity to do research for people who like to be hands-on about research. Since you're an undergraduate, most of your work has probably been hands-on, so take advantage of that and talk about your impact!

Ensure you can explain your research to non-technical people and do mock interviews with other grad students or your PI.

**Questions about you and your research**

1. Tell us a little bit about yourself!
    1. Here's what I said for mine. I like to write my elevator pitches in bullet points so that they are easier for me to memorize. 
    
    > Computer science with a minor in statistics at UIUC
 research interests
    > 
    > - HCI
    > - Natural Language Processing
    > - Accessibility
    > 
    > Social CompUting laBorAtory
    > 
    > - Summer: Classifying Voice Social Platforms (ABSPs) (Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces)
    >     - Submitted to ACM CSCW (in review cycle)
    > - Fall: Project about community resiliency on Reddit.
2. What kind of projects have you worked on, and what have your contributions been?
3. Could you explain x concept in depth (explain the concept non-technically)?
4. Why did you make x choice with your research?
5. What were the most challenging parts of the research process? What parts of the research process did you dislike and why?
6. What are some conclusions you drew from this research?
7. What is the significance of your research?
8. Did you enjoy x part of the process?
9. What are some challenges you encountered?
10. What future routes do you hope to take with this project?
11. What are some of your strengths and weaknesses?

**Questions about you and MSR**

1. What do you look for in a good mentor?
2. Did you enjoy working with x mentor? What about them did you like or dislike?
3. What would you consider a good outcome from the internship?
    1. Examples are learning a method or technical skill, publishing, and working on a certain type of project (which can be risky if that project is unavailable).
4. What kind of work would you like to do? What kind of contributions would you want to make to projects?
    1. methods, writing, technical skills, publishing, etc.
    

**Questions about methods** 

They did not ask me much of these, but they can ask anyone!

1. Explain how you would analyze data.
2. Explain x technical concept
3. Maybe an easy-ish leet code question to check that you know how to code

**Last part: ask the interviewer(s) questions**

Here are some example questions you can ask your interviewers:

1. What kind of projects have previous interns worked with?
2. I don't have much access to what industrial research internships look like, so what would be the scope of my role and contributions as an intern?

## Offers and Compensation

I'm including this since I was unable to find any information on how much interns were compensated online.

**Monetary Compensation**

- $7500-8000/month salary (I've heard people getting in this range based on seniority and experience)
- $3500 housing stipend (this was during COVID-19 when the internship was virtual, but afaik, it goes up to 7000$ for in-person internships)
UPDATE: before the visit week in June 2022, they increased our housing stipend to $7,000 in case we wanted to stay in Seattle after.
- $450 credit for Microsoft software

**Other Details**

- You can choose your start and end date (they give you a table to help you decide)
- Health insurance and Vision benefits are included for the time that you are an intern
- For past virtual years, they have sent you a computer (usually a ThinkPad or Surface), mouse, monitor, headphones, or something similar. Also, if there's something specific your lab uses to do work, they will send that to you. 
- I was sent Surface Headphones and an Oculus Quest as intern gifts!
