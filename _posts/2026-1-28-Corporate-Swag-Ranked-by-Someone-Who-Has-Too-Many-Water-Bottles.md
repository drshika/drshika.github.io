<!--more-->
* Made swag purchasing decisions for many events and organizations  
* I have opinions 

For each item, I will rank the item by novelty and price on a scale of 0/5, where:

**Price:** This is to get the lowest viable quality level of the item with 0 minimum purchase quantity. Prices are in USD.

* 0 \- $0-10 per unit  
* 1 \- $10-30 per unit  
* 2 \- $30-50 per unit

* 0 \- least novel  
* 1 \- somewhat common  
* 2 \- moderately common  
* 3 \- moderately rare  
* 4 \- quite rare

**Disclaimer:**

* I don't speak for all swag receivers or SWEs; this is my own personal experience and opinion.  
* I'm very grateful for the privilege of receiving swag.  
* My intention is to make it easier for folks to purchase nice merch at any budget without excess waste.  
* I am not sponsored by any of these brands, and everything I link on here is my genuine recommendation.  
* The brands I list are brands that I have personal experience with and recommend based on quality.  
* Feel free to disregard my opinion and do whatever you want if you disagree with anything I say.

**Note:** Items marked with an asterisk (\*) are ones I haven't personally received but think would be a good idea based on my experience.

## **Apparel**

**1\. Socks \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I've got many from conferences, and I love these. Keep it coming. Just get ones made of high-quality material so I don't have to toss them within a year. A cute design is always a plus.

**2\. Sweatpants \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 1,2/5\]**

I feel like people don't give enough of these. I'm more likely to wear these out in the winter if they're warm and I'm a huge fan. With all apparel, I'm more likely to keep it if the branding is minimal and it's a solid color.

**3\. Beanies \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 1/5\]**

I have received a couple from hackathons, but I don't like them since they mess up my curly hair. I'd recommend looking into satin-lined options if getting these.

***4\. Slides/Slippers \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 1/5\]*****\***

I've never received these, but branded house slippers could be nice holiday swag\!

**5\. Umbrella \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Umbrella: I love these, keep it coming. Choosing a small form factor is a plus, so I can take it traveling. They're also great for guests in a pinch.

**6\. Coats \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 3,4/5\]**

Brands: [North Face](https://www.ssactivewear.com/ps/the-north-face), [Columbia](https://www.ssactivewear.com/ps/columbia), [Champion](https://www.ssactivewear.com/ps/champion)

I've received a North Face puffer jacket. I really like it as it is my fall/spring jacket. Coats are expensive, though, so don't buy unless you can't afford a good-quality item.

**7\. Baseball Hats \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Got these as conference swag. Not my taste, but one of my friends really likes them.

**8\. Accessories \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 1/5\]**

I definitely don't speak for everyone on this, as I lose winter accessories super quickly, so I tend not to wear them unless I need them.

**Winter Hat:** My favorite winter hat of all time was actually hackathon swag, and I'm so bummed I lost it. It's really hard to find a hat that fits my head, and that one just worked. As with the beanies, satin lining is always appreciated. Hats are kind of a hit-or-miss in my opinion. If they don't fit me, they get donated.

**Gloves/Mittens:** are always appreciated since I lose them easily.

**Scarf:** I've received one scarf, but it's on the thinner side and not suited for NY winters.

**9\. Sweater/Jacket \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 3,4/5\]**

Brands: [Columbia](https://www.ssactivewear.com/ps/columbia), [Champion](https://www.ssactivewear.com/ps/champion)

**Full-zip jackets:** Not my personal taste, as the zippers get warped in the wash pretty quickly and look gross really quickly.

**Quarter Zip:** I'm quarter zip pilled, and I have sooooo many. I love fleece, cotton, windbreakers, and down/down-alternative jackets\!

**Rain Jacket:** My favorite jacket I've received is my rain jacket, since it's so versatile and packable.

**Athletic:** I don't like the thin, plasticy athletic quarter-zips much, so I wouldn't cheap out on the brand if you plan to purchase that kind of stuff.

**Vest:** I'm not a vest person, but I did receive one, and it seems to be of good quality. I suppose a lot of this is dependent on personal taste.

Fleece is always appreciated for the cold weather, and anything that's packable will get lots of use. If at this point I get a hoodie or quarter zip, it will either be donated or replace something in my current collection.

**10\. T-Shirt \[Novelty: 0/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Brands: [Bella+Canvas](https://www.customink.com/products/featured-brands/bella-+-canvas/458), [Hanes Comfort Colors](https://www.customink.com/products/t-shirts/short-sleeve-t-shirts/hanes-comfort-colors-t-shirt/122000)

I am pro more T-shirts, even if they're not novel, just make the material actually comfy. I rarely wear my free T-shirts out after the event I received them at, so either they're nice PJ material, or they get tossed. I would avoid heat transfer printing because the letters will peel off and look crusty over time. Subtle branding in the same color as the T-shirt's material is also greatly appreciated and helps it get worn outside the house. For example, if you did a white T-shirt with white embroidery, I would probably wear it in an outfit.

## **Tech**

**1\. Keyboard \[Novelty: 5/5, Price: 4/5\]**

Brands: [Drop](https://drop.com/)

By far the most insane swag I've ever received is a branded mechanical keyboard at a conference. It is this cute matcha green color, and it sounds super nice when you type. Although I use a split keyboard now, I was super grateful for it in college since my desk setup was super minimal before that.

**2\. VR Headset \[Novelty: 5/5, Price: 4/5\]**

Brands: [Meta](https://www.meta.com/quest/)

I got an Oculus Quest from an internship. I don't use it much now, but it was a lot of fun when I was doing research and playing with friends.

***3\. Cable Organizers \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 0/5\]*****\***

I think this would be a very fun idea for tabling at conferences. It's super useful to tie up your cables while travelling, and I would definitely grab many.

***4\. Laptop Stand \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 2/5\]*****\***

This could be a cool intern gift\! Or if you're planning to give this to working professionals, I would go with a travel version. Most working professionals I know have their desk setups figured out, or teams at in-person workplaces provide ergonomic setups. Which is why I don't feel that it will get many takers at conferences.

**5\. Drinkware (Heated Mugs) \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 3/5\]**

Brands: [Ember](https://ember.com/)

I got an electric heated mug from an internship, and I thought it was pretty nice\! This is expensive, so it would make a nice intern or employee gift.

***6\. Laptop Sleeve \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 2/5\]*****\***

I've seen this offered as conference and intern swag. I've always been a 16-inch laptop person, and I already have a backpack that cushions my laptop pretty well, so I would personally skip this. I know others who like this, though.

**8\. Speakers \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 2-3/5\]**

Brands: [JBL](https://www.jbl.com/)

Depending on which size you get, these get more expensive. I have received many cheap ones that eventually got recycled. I wouldn't cheap out since many people can just replace yours with a nicer one. Waterproof ones that work in the bathroom or on hikes are underrated in this category.

**9\. Audio \[Novelty: 2-3/5, Price: 3-4/5\]**

Brands: [Sony](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/), [Apple AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/)

I've received headphones as part of my internship. They were super nice, and I wore them a ton, but I ended up not being an over-the-ear headphones kind of person since they were heavy. If going over the head, prioritize cross-platform and lightweight solutions that work for everyone.

Apple AirPods are the most cliched hackathon prize of all time. Great for iOS users, but Android users will definitely struggle to get the full utility from these. Consider cross-platform brands like Bose or Sony.

**10\. Ergonomic Stuff \[Novelty 5/5, Price: ⅖\]**

I think this is a gap that can be explored more. Vertical mice or wrist rests could be a cool employee gift, as they're used daily and aren't super common. I personally love my vertical mouse, and my keyboard comes with wrist rests.

**11\. Coasters \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I got some ceramic ones from an internship. Coasters seem easy but they’re difficult to get right. The silicone ones on the market let the condensation slide right off. If you spill non-water drinks on the cork or plastic ones, the residue remains. I don’t feel like any of the options on the market are truly at the same level as ones I could buy for myself and I’d rather pay to have unbranded ones. If I received this as swag, I would probably donate it.

**12\. Portable Charger \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 1/5\]**

I got this at a conference, and I always travel with one since I tend to use my phone a lot for navigation and all. This is HIGHLY appreciated, and you don't need that much money to get a nice one. You definitely get bonus points if there are cables attached to the back, so you don't have to remember to pack one of your own. From my experience, loose cables also tend to stop working from being crammed in your purse/bag.

***13\. Desk Organizers \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 1/5\]*****\***

I've seen these given out as employee gifts. I would use this if I worked in person, but probably not if I saw them at a conference and had to decide whether to take it home.

***14\. USB Drives \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]*****\***

I got this as college merch. I think flash drives are still underrated today. Mine was USB 2.0, and I used it to flash Linux to my PC. But if you're buying this today, I would go for the multi-USB ones to cater to the digi cam folks. I would definitely grab it if I saw this at a conference.

## **Food/Kitchen**

**1\. Picnic lunch kit \[Novelty: 5/5, Price ⅕\]**

I got this swag during an internship. It was a picnic kit that served two people. Given that most picnics I go on are multiple-person events, this doesn't really get used. But this is a cute idea\!

**2\. Bento Box \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Brands: [Gemline Osaka Bento Lunch Box](https://gemline.com/s/product/osaka-bento-lunch-box/01tTN000001haZAYAY)

This was actually something I purchased for a program I ran in college. I love it so much, it's super useful for packed lunches.

**3\. Travel Utensils \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I love these\! I got some from a conference. It's super low-cost, and I used to pack lunches and take the utensils with me.

**4\. Reusable Straws \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Amazing\! I love them, I could always have more :<zero-width space>)

**5\. Ice Cream Scoop \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Brands: [Zeroll](https://www.zeroll.com/)

I got one as merch. The design isn't super nice, but it is used pretty regularly. If you're planning to purchase one, go for a full-metal body that conducts heat (like the Zeroll brand).

***6\. Cutting Board \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 2/5\]*****\***

I've never received these, but it could be a cute idea\! I personally like using wood composite ones in my kitchen since they're dishwasher-safe and low-maintenance, with the benefit of wood.

**7\. Box Cutter/Bottle Openers \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I have gotten many from conferences, and it was nice when I was in college. I bought a super nice one recently, so if I see this at a conference, I won't pick it up, but I know a lot of folks who would appreciate it.

**8\. Koozies/Can Coolers \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Whenever I have a canned drink, I guarantee I will not have one of these on me, because one can only fit so many things in a purse. These go straight in the trash for me. I've not met a single person who uses their branded drink koozie.

**9\. Tea Towels/Kitchen Towels \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I got so many during college, and they have been so useful. If I were receiving this as an adult, I would definitely want more discreet branding/cute design since I already have tea towels. I would avoid purchasing heat-transfer ones, since the letters will peel off and look crusty.

**10\. Insulated Mugs/Tumblers/Water Bottles \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Brands: [Yeti](https://www.yeti.com/)

I also love these\! I'm very saturated with drinkware, though, so if I receive another one, it will get donated/swapped out. Make sure whatever you choose is dishwasher-safe and that the writing won't come off. I'm personally partial to stainless steel, so if I see a plastic/ceramic one, I wouldn't pick it up at a conference. I also feel like the sizes are a bit large for most caffeinated coffee and tea drinks, so maybe some glasses that are properly sized for coffee and matcha could be cool?

## **Travel**

***1\. Concert Travel Earplugs \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 0/5\]*****\***

Brands: [Loop](https://www.loopearplugs.com/)

These are super underrated as merch items, especially for conferences. I would definitely grab these since I take many flights and go to many concerts.

***2\. Compression Socks \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 1/5\]*****\***

See [Socks](#apparel)

***3\. Packing Cubes \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 2/5\]*****\***

I think it would be a cool idea. This could be so cute in an employee holiday gift or as conference merch.

**4\. Picnic Blanket \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 2/5\]**

LOVE these\! I already have two (from my internship and school), but I'm a huge fan of them as swag.

***5\. Passport Holder \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 1/5\]*****\***

These are super underrated as merch items, especially for conferences. I would definitely grab these since I take many flights. Having ones that can keep foreign currency and multiple passports/visas is greatly appreciated.

**6\. Toiletry Bag \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 2/5\]**

I've seen many of these at conferences, and I've grabbed every one. These pouches get used for so many random things like first aid, makeup, hygiene kit… so I will never pass them up. I think the hanging style is best, since you don't need much counter space and can see all your things easily, but the pouch style is also tried and true.

***7\. Travel Pillow \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 2/5\]*****\***

I'm not personally a travel pillow person, but I think there are people who would appreciate a travel pillow at a conference and would give your brand great visibility, since they're likely to use it on the flight home, and it doesn't take up extra luggage space when worn.

**8\. Purses/Belt Bags \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 2/5\]**

Brands: [Cotopaxi](https://www.cotopaxi.com/), [Lululemon](https://shop.lululemon.com/)

I'm a huge fan of the Uniqlo half-moon bag or the Lululemon belt bag. I've also received a Cotopaxi belt bag. Belt bags are great and get so much use when I travel.

**9\. Laundry Bag \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Super cheap and mine has gotten so much use\! I always bring it with me while traveling.

**10\. Sleeping Masks \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I'm always happy to have these. Give the high-quality weighted cooling ones.

***11\. Insulated Lunch Bag/Cooler \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 1/5\]*****\***

I have never received this, but if you have employees who bring lunch into the office, I think this would be amazing\! Also, if someone already has this item, I think it would work well for folks in shelters.

**12\. Bag Tags \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Also greatly appreciated\! It's always a struggle to find my bag at the airport.

***13\. Electric Hand Warmers \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]*****\***

This would be a great idea as an employee holiday gift or as conference swag in a cold location\! I know runners find these useful, or just anyone who lives in a cold climate. (Manual ones are great too, but I've never tried them or know how good they are)

**14\. Duffle Bag \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 2/5\]**

I love these\! If you opt for the packable variety, they're super nice for traveling abroad and packing souvenirs on the way back. Would grab 10/10.

**15\. Carabiners \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

My preferred key storage method is a carabiner (which I have received as corporate merch), so I would definitely grab one\! I know I might be an outlier here and that these might be less popular in reality.

**16\. Backpacks \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 3/5\]**

Brands: [The North Face](https://www.thenorthface.com/), [Incase](https://www.incase.com/)

I have a hot take: Don't do backpacks if you're gonna cheap out. Also, if you know your target demographic uses big laptops, make sure the backpack fits them. I received a super nice backpack, but it didn't fit my work laptop, so I donated it to my younger brother. I've also received backpacks with a laptop compartment and no false bottom, so I basically can't use them, since the laptop would be more likely to break. I know that everyone has their personal preferences when it comes to backpacks, but my favorite swag backpack has to be the Incase one. I also generally like backpacks with just one big compartment, since I can pack some clothes in there for a weekend trip. Since I'm WFH, I don't use commuting backpacks much.

## **Stationary**

**1\. Playing Cards \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I love these, especially if they have a fun design.

**2\. Pins \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Sandwich-style pins are cheaper and fun to give out, but depending on the print material, they can fade over time. Enamel pins last longer, and I prefer these. I'm more likely to pick these up from your booth if they have a cute design, not just your logo. Bonus points if you have the locking backs, since I lose my pins super easily.

**3\. Pencils \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Brands: [Uni Kurutoga](https://uniballco.com/collections/kurutoga), [Palomino Blackwing](https://palominobrand.com/blackwing)

I've received many cheap, branded mechanical pencils, but if someone gave me a branded Uni Kurutoga, I would use it alllll the time. Orrrr a branded Palomino blackwing.

**4\. Pencil Case \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I guess this kinda depends. I've personally received plain pouches in this category. My personal preference is the cylindrical ones that open from the top, since I can also use them for travel makeup brushes. A plain pouch is always nice because it can be used for many purposes.

**5\. Stickers \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

I love a cute sticker that's not just your brand name. Make sure you purchase the waterproof variety so people can stick it on their water bottles or other regular-use surfaces. There are also manufacturers who do repositionable ones, which is nice if you have extra budget.

**6\. Pens \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Brands: [Uni 207](https://uniballco.com/collections/signo-207), [Pilot Jetstream](https://www.pilotpen.us/categories/jetstream-pens/), [RSVP](https://www.pilotpen.us/brands/better-ballpoint-pens/rsvp-ballpoint-pens/)

I will always appreciate a good pen. Uni 207, Pilot Jetstream, and RSVP are all great pens. Get a high-quality one, and I guarantee the person who receives it will use it for a long time. Branded fountain pens definitely add a nice novelty factor in exchange for practicality.

**7\. Sticky Notes \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Brands: [Post-it](https://www.post-it.com/)

I have received on-and-off brand versions. Get the brand-name ones since the off-brand ones aren't as sticky.

**8\. Erasers \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Brands: [Pentel Hi-Polymer](https://www.pentel.com/collections/erasers)

I'm always losing them, so if you get a good brand, I will keep using it\! Pentel is my favorite brand that I've used in my personal life. None of the branded erasers I got were great.

**9\. Calendars \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Not my taste, but I know people like them.

**10\. Webcam Covers \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

This is a pass for me since it will break my Mac screen.

**11\. Notebooks \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Brands: [Leuchtturm1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/), [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/)

A nice, high-quality notebook is super nice. Extra nice if it lies flat, is perforated, and comes with a pocket for extra paper at the end. Basically a Leuchtturm lol. I've also gotten padfolios in mini and large sizes. I prefer the mini.

**12\. Paper Pads \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 1/5\]**

I remember getting many of these from realtors in the mail when I was growing up. And they would also get used to making notes. It's nice if there's a magnet attached to the back so it sticks to a fridge.

## **Other**

**1\. Lego Set \[Novelty: 5/5, Price: 2/5\]**

This is such a cute idea\! My friend got one from his company, but he wasn't the type to use it :<zero-width space>(

**2\. Succulent \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Got this at a conference, and it was so cute\! But it didn't travel well back home in my suitcase.

**3\. Plushies \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 1/5\]**

I have received a plush unicorn from work\! Definitely do this if your company has a cute mascot. Specific to tech, but if your team works in a programming language with an animal mascot, it would be fun to receive a plush of that :<zero-width space>)

**4\. Fancy Dice \[Novelty: 4/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Could be a fun idea\! You could choose colors based on your company colors. You could also go the D\&D route and choose cool resin ones with your brand colors. Might give strong gambling vibes though (for normal 6-sided ones).

***5\. Candle \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 2/5\]*****\***

I avoid candles and scented things due to allergies. Will skip. I can't speak for others on this, because most of my friends aren't strong scent fans either.

**6\. Phone/MagSafe Accessories \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 1/5\]**

Brands: [PopSocket](https://www.popsockets.com/), [MOFT](https://www.moft.us/)

I feel like all versions of this are super nice. I've received silicone card sleeves, branded PopSockets, and ring phone grips. I currently have a corporate swag one that looks like the MOFT one on the back of my phone that folds into a stand/grip and holds two cards. If you want to go this route and get a nice one, I'd recommend Pop Sockets or MOFT-style, since they're functional and nice-looking.

**7\. Fidget Toys \[Novelty: 3/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Brands: [Needoh](https://www.schylling.com/collections/nee-doh), [Tangle](https://tanglecreations.com/)

I've seen these at conferences, and if someone did a high-quality branded needoh, tangle, or one of those magnet toys, I would love it. Basically, anything that doesn't look like a kid's toy and isn't loud. I'll skip these if it's a traditional stress ball since I feel like they roll everywhere and aren't the right kind of squishy for my taste.

**8\. Hand Sanitizer/Lens Wipes \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

Brands: [4 Imprint Example](https://www.4imprint.com/)

I will always grab one, it's so useful. I would go for the ones that are better than the lowest quality, since the cheapest ones aren't really great at cleaning glasses.

**9\. Pennants \[Novelty: 2/5, Price: 0/5\]**

This works well if you're a college sending merch to students. I've seen companies do this, but I wouldn't personally put up a pennant for a company I'm working for or have worked for.

***10\. Tote/Drawstring Bags \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 1/5\]*****\***

Brands: [Bungalow Foldable Tote](https://www.bungalow.com/)

I have received many of these as swag, and at this point, it's a skip for me. Mostly because I am loyal to my Shupatto, and it comes with me everywhere. If you want something that is likely to be of daily use for people, using higher-quality materials like canvas or focusing on utility, like packable grocery bags, might result in it being used more.

**11\. Keychains \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

It's a skip from me. Even if your keychain does something fancy and cool. Adding weight to my purse is not compelling.

**12\. Lanyards \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

It's a skip from me. I have so many from conferences and school that I'm set for a lifetime. I think this would be useful for college students, though\!

**13\. Magnets \[Novelty: 1/5, Price: 0/5\]**

The only format of this I like is magnet bag clips. I will skip everything else. I did enjoy getting college-branded magnets, so if you're ordering this as school merch, I am a fan of that use case.

## **Final Recommendations**

Depends on your audience, but I think the best solution is a merch store/survey/form. Folks can "purchase" what they want, and there is no waste.

For conferences, my advice is to theme your merch around your company. For example, if you are a trading company, you can make playing cards or wooden puzzles. If you're an outdoor goods brand, you could do a branded shovel. If you are tabling, I would recommend having each individual item out rather than a swag bag. That way, folks can choose what items they want to take home and avoid waste.

If you're gonna do swag at all, either novelty factor, utility, or high quality is a must. Otherwise, it's a waste of money imo.

I hope this was helpful, and I'm always happy to talk swag with anyone who has further questions\! Thanks for reading :<zero-width space>)
