## DESCRIPTION 

My name is Drshika. I’m a (currently on hiatus) 16th grade student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science with a minor in technology and management. 

I’m interested in learning more about Virtual/Augmented Reality, Accessibility, and Social Computing and have been researching with the HCI and SCuBa laboratory through the Clare Boothe Luce and CS STARS Research Fellowship. 

My studies and research are supported by scholarships from JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Cargill, Clare Boothe Luce Foundation and others.

I love to help others and was a head course assistant for CS225 (Data Structures) and CS196 (honors computer science).

In my free time, I indulge in singing hindustani classical music, biking on local trails, and attempting to cook various deserts.

## [NEWS](#news)

## RESEARCH

   <div class="subhead purple-text"><b>OVER-TRUST IN AUTOMATED SYSTEMS,</b> UIUC HCI LAB [2022]</div>

*Mentors: Prof. Alex Kirlik and Sebastian Rodriguez*. I worked with the UIUC Human-Computer Interaction lab on a project about embodied agents in the context of trust, performance, and embodiment in a physical VR task. I contributed ideas in terms of shaping experimental design, researched and analyzed papers to the review of literature and helped design the VR game itself by programming in C# and Unity. I also dry ran the experiment with peers until it was ready to execute at a larger scale. 

   <div class="subhead purple-text"><b>CLASSIFYING AUDIO-SOCIAL PLATFORMS,</b>SCuBa LAB [2021]</div>

*Mentors: Prof. Eshwar Chandrashekaran and Tanvi Bajpai*. I investigated the structure and norms of the voice based platform Clubhouse and documented the different forms of abuse on voice based platforms like Twitter Spaces, Discord Stages as well as Spotify Greenroom. We analyzed these trends using Natural Language Processing techniques like LDA and SAGE. See my talk from the virtual REU poster session [here](https://cs.illinois.edu/research/undergraduate-research/summer-research-experience-undergraduates/participants/drshika-asher)

## INDUSTRY
   <div class="subhead purple-text"><b>UBER</b>, Software Engineering Intern [2023]</div>

I'm excited to be starting my internship with the Uber Eats engineering team in San Francisco!

   <div class="subhead purple-text"><b>CARGILL</b>, Software Engineering Intern [2022]</div>

I was a software engineering intern with the Cargill Innovation lab where I collaborated with international stakeholders to build a unified React component library.

   <div class="subhead purple-text"><b>ENTERPRISEWORKS</b>, Front-End Developer [2021]</div>

Over the summer of 2021, I had my first internship with EnterpriseWorks, a startup incubator. I build over 20 pages of websites for both internal and external clients and got fluent with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP! This internship was an amazing learning experience for me and I really enjoyed working with the team.

## PROJECTS

   <div class="subhead purple-text"><b>TANPURA APP</b> --github_link=<a href="https://github.com/drshika/tanpura-app">https://github.com/drshika/tanpura-app</a></div>

I developed a virtual Tanpura Simulator with 7 keys using Cinder’s Audio API Library. Used C++, Cinder, and CMake.

   <div class="subhead purple-text"><b>HANDWRITING CLASSIFIER</b></div>

I created a model using the Naive-Bayes Classifier algorithm to predict the number that a user draws on a sketchpad. I trained the model with 5000 handwritings, and tests the model with 1000 handwritings with an accuracy of 98%. Since this was a school project, I cannot link the code. Used C++, Cinder, and CMake.

   <div class="subhead purple-text"><b>LCTRS</b> --github_link=<a href="https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Group6">https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Group6</a></div>

I prototyped a tool to summarize lecture transcripts to assist students in online learning. We fine-tuned the T-5 Small model to summarize conversational academic content. I designed and built a front-end user interface with Flask and Google OAuth for users to store their past summarized transcripts.
