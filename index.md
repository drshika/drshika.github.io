## DESCRIPTION 

My name is Drshika. I’m a 14th grade student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. 

I’m interested in learning more about Virtual/Augmented Reality, Accessibility, and Social Computing and have been researching with the HCI and SCuBa laboratory through the CS STARS Research Fellowship.

I love to help others and am a course assistant for CS225 (Data Structures) currently and CS196 (honors computer science) in the past.

In my free time, I indulge in singing hindustani classical music, biking on local trails, and attempting to cook various deserts.

## [RESEARCH](#research)

   **OVER-TRUST IN AUTOMATED SYSTEMS,** <div class="purple-text">UIUC HCI LAB [2022]<div class="purple-text">

Mentors: Prof. Alex Kirlik and Sebastian Rodriguez. I’m currently working on a project that’s examining how good automation systems are. Working with C# and Unity to build a game that determines whether the physicality of the agent affects user trust.

   **CLASSIFYING AUDIO-SOCIAL PLATFORMS,** <div class="purple-text">SCuBa LAB [2021]<div class="purple-text">

Mentors: Prof. Eshwar Chandrashekaran and Tanvi Bajpai. I investigated the structure and norms of the voice based platform Clubhouse and documented the different forms of abuse on voice based platforms like Twitter Spaces, Discord Stages as well as Spotify Greenroom. We analyzed these trends using Natural Language Processing techniques like LDA and SAGE. See my talk from the virtual REU poster session [here](https://cs.illinois.edu/research/undergraduate-research/summer-research-experience-undergraduates/participants/drshika-asher)

   **PUBLICATIONS**

Harmonizing the Cacophony: An Affordance-aware Framework of Audio-Based Social Platform Moderation

## [INDUSTRY](#industry)

   **CARGILL,** <div class="purple-text">Software Engineering Intern [2022]<div class="purple-text">

I’m currently a software engineering intern with the Cargill Innovation lab where I am collaborating with international stakeholders to build a unified react component library.

   **ENTERPRISEWORKS,** <div class="purple-text">Front-End Developer [2021]<div class="purple-text">

Over the summer of 2021, I had my first internship with EnterpriseWorks, a startup incubator. I build over 20 pages of websites for both internal and external clients and got fluent with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP! This internship was an amazing learning experience for me and I really enjoyed working with the team.

## [PROJECTS](#projects)

   **TANPURA APP \-\-github_link=**[https://github.com/drshika/tanpura-app](https://github.com/drshika/tanpura-app)

I developed a virtual Tanpura Simulator with 7 keys using Cinder’s Audio API Library. Used C++, Cinder, and CMake.

   **HANDWRITING CLASSIFIER**

I developed a virtual Tanpura Simulator with 7 keys uI created a model using the Naive-Bayes Classifier algorithm to predict the number that a user draws on a sketchpad. I trained the model with 5000 handwritings, and tests the model with 1000 handwritings with an accuracy of 98%. Since this was a school project, I cannot link the code. Used C++, Cinder, and CMake.

   **LCTRS \-\-github_link=**[https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Group6](https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Group6)

I prototyped a tool to summarize lecture transcripts to assist students in online learning. We fine-tuned the T-5 Small model to summarize conversational academic content. I designed and built a front-end user interface with Flask and Google OAuth for users to store their past summarized transcripts.
