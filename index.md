## DESCRIPTION 

Hey, I'm Drshika! I recently graduated from UIUC and moved to New York. Currently, I'm a Research Software Engineer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. I was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois and the city holds such a special place in my heart that I have a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0GOlx5tIU2eruC47yMRmrO?si=35f55188f7744fd9) dedicated to it. 
{: .section-content}

During college, I was involved with a lot of undergraduate research, head TA-ships (or as the CS department at UIUC calls them, CA-ships) and club leadership. My studies and research were supported by scholarships from JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Cargill, Clare Boothe Luce Foundation and others. To add some spice to my life, I spent my senior year in college interning for [Japan House](https://japanhouse.illinois.edu/) where I whisked countless bowls of matcha and learned to dress in Yukata!

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing trivia with my friends, practicing hindustani classical music, teaching myself to embroider or curating hyper-specific playlists on Spotify.

## RESEARCH

**OVER-TRUST IN AUTOMATED SYSTEMS, UIUC HCI LAB** [2022]
{: .sub-header}

*Mentors: Prof. Alex Kirlik and Sebastian Rodriguez*. I worked with the UIUC Human-Computer Interaction lab on a project about embodied agents in the context of trust, performance, and embodiment in a physical VR task. I contributed ideas in terms of shaping experimental design, researched and analyzed papers to the review of literature and helped design the VR game itself by programming in C# and Unity. I also dry ran the experiment with peers until it was ready to execute at a larger scale.

**CLASSIFYING AUDIO-SOCIAL PLATFORMS,SCuBa LAB** [2021]
{: .sub-header}

*Mentors: Prof. Eshwar Chandrashekaran and Tanvi Bajpai*. I investigated the structure and norms of the voice based platform Clubhouse and documented the different forms of abuse on voice based platforms like Twitter Spaces, Discord Stages as well as Spotify Greenroom. We analyzed these trends using Natural Language Processing techniques like LDA and SAGE. See my talk from the virtual REU poster session [here](https://cs.illinois.edu/research/undergraduate-research/summer-research-experience-undergraduates/participants/drshika-asher)
